Earthquake Data Visualization - Part 1
This repository contains the solution for Part 1 of the Earthquake Data Visualization assignment. In this part, I focused on creating visual representations of earthquake data using various plotting techniques, including bubble charts to display the magnitude and depth of earthquakes, and pop-ups to show detailed information about each earthquake.

Overview
In this project, I visualized earthquake data with the following steps:

Bubble Chart Visualization:

I used circles to represent the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.
The size of the circles corresponds to the magnitude of each earthquake.
The color of the circles represents the depth of the earthquake.
Pop-up Information:

Each circle (representing an earthquake) includes a pop-up that displays the location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake. This provides more context and helps interpret the data visually.
Legend:

I included a legend in the map using CSS. The legend dynamically populates a colored box, which helps identify the depth range associated with the colors of the circles.
Tools and Resources Used
Python and Matplotlib/Plotly for creating visualizations.
CSS for styling the legend and pop-ups.
ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, Tutoring, and Peers for assistance with troubleshooting and coding challenges.
Previous classes and materials for guidance on how to visualize the data and use pop-ups effectively.
Key Features
Circle Size & Color:

The circle size is directly proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake, providing a quick visual indication of the earthquake's severity.
The color of each circle is determined by the depth of the earthquake, which helps differentiate shallow and deep earthquakes.
Pop-up Information:

Each circle includes a pop-up showing the location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake, providing an easy way to access detailed data without overcrowding the map.
Legend:

A legend is included to help users understand what the different colors and circle sizes represent in terms of earthquake depth and magnitude.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib, CSS for styling).
Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run the earthquake data visualization.
Make sure to adjust the input data if necessary, based on your dataset.

Conclusion
This project provided a great opportunity to learn and implement various data visualization techniques to represent earthquake data. I focused on Part 1 of the assignment, creating intuitive bubble charts with pop-ups for more detailed earthquake information. The additional graphs and work I did during the project helped me gain a better understanding of how to represent complex data in an easy-to-understand way.
